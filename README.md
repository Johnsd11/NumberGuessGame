# NumberGuessGame
A fun JS exercise that is a helps me learn java while creating something I can play.

You can play the game by inputing your guess number between 1 and 20. 
If the number is too high, you will get a message saying so, the same goes for if the number is too low.
You can press the again button to keep your highscore and try to improve on it in the next game.
